# Visual Validation

Visual validation exists because a valid PDF structure does not prove visual fidelity. The harness renders an Office-produced reference, renders the candidate PDF with PDFium, compares PNG pages, and creates files that an agent or contributor can inspect.

## Requirements

- Windows with Microsoft Office installed.
- PowerShell.
- .NET SDK.
- `tools/vendor/pdfium/win-x64/bin/pdfium.dll`.

Retrieve PDFium from:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries/releases/latest/download/pdfium-win-x64.tgz -OutFile pdfium-win-x64.tgz
```

Unpack it so `pdfium.dll` lives under `tools/vendor/pdfium/win-x64/bin/`.

## Running A Case

```powershell
pwsh tools/CheckVisualCase.ps1 -Case visual-cases/cases/docx-basic-paragraphs/case.json
```

The script:

1. Builds the CLI and converts the test input to `candidate/output.pdf`.
2. Uses PowerPoint or Word COM automation to render reference output.
3. Rasterizes the candidate PDF through the local PDFium rasterizer.
4. Runs `Lokad.OoxPdf.VisualDiff`.
5. Writes an `assessment.md` template.

Outputs are timestamped under:

```text
artifacts/visual/<case-id>/<run-id>/
```

Important files:

- `reference/page-001.png`: Office reference page.
- `candidate/output.pdf`: generated candidate PDF.
- `candidate/page-001.png`: PDFium rasterization of the candidate.
- `candidate/diagnostics.json`: emitted renderer diagnostics.
- `comparison/metrics.json`: dimensions and pixel-difference metrics.
- `comparison/index.html`: side-by-side browser review.
- `assessment.md`: agent review notes and rating.

## Assessment

Pixel metrics are advisory. Office and PDFium can differ in antialiasing, font hinting, and rasterization details even when the PDF is acceptable. The assessment rating is the authoritative result:

- `5`: visually indistinguishable except tiny antialiasing differences.
- `4`: good; minor spacing, kerning, or antialiasing differences only.
- `3`: usable; visible but non-blocking differences.
- `2`: poor; major layout defects or missing important elements.
- `1`: severe; page or slide mostly wrong.
- `0`: conversion failed or page missing.

Do not commit generated visual artifacts unless they are intentionally small fixtures. Record durable results in `EXECPLAN.md`.
