# Native DOCX equations

Native OMML rendering is in progress. The reader retains equation position,
display alignment, resolved run formatting, revision visibility and mathematical
structure for literals, scripts and fractions. Unsupported or incomplete
constructs retain an explicit source representation. Equations are separate from
prose runs, preserving existing field, bookmark, note and picture indices.

This source representation does not yet paint equations. Conversion continues
to report `DOCX_UNSUPPORTED_EQUATION` with the existing part provenance and
`Ignored` fallback. There is no claim of mathematical fidelity from prose-only
PDF output. Measurement and painting will share a math-box model, qualified
against independent Word references before supported diagnostics change.

Literal-row component measurement and painting now use the same bounded glyph
box model, with mathematical alphabet selection, operator spacing and explicit
fallbacks. The isolated inline reference passes the existing DOCX visual gates.
The display reference retains a positioning residual and remains under review;
substituting Word positions is a diagnostic only. These checks do not qualify
DOCX paragraph placement, wrapping or pagination. Scripts and fractions remain
outside the first component slice, with their source structure preserved.

The six `docx-omml-*` test inputs were authored with Lokad.DocxEdit 0.2.0 at
revision `67e303117f3e51465f3da3d4971c357c091d407c`. They contain these expressions
in both inline and display positions:

| Fixture kind | DocxEdit LaTeX input |
| --- | --- |
| literal | `\alpha+\beta=\gamma` |
| scripts | `x_i^2` |
| fraction | `\frac{a+b}{c}` |

The authoring tool and Word reference renderer are validation tools only.
Neither is a dependency of the entirely safe managed OoxPdf library.
